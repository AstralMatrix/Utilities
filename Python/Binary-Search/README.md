This is a slightly more advanced version then a standard binary search
for python.

The actual binary search component is standard. Although, it when the
item is not found, it provides the index in which the item should be
inserted to keep your data in sorted order. This eliminates the need to
find where an item should be inserted into your data. In addition to
this, it provides the ability to access your data and search item with
keys, so you can search much more specific parts of your data.
